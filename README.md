It follows a list of changes, the original documentation by Hartwig is printed below 
for completeness.


New control parameters:  
     ctrl (default 3)    If spin is not 0 this switches exact quadrupole coupling on (3) or off (0) 
                           by discarding matrix elements off-diagonal in J. 
     ctrl 0 : Switches to XIAM_mod - matrix elements off-diagonal in J are ignored. It allows for 
                analytical gradients for rigid rotor parameters and an increase in the torsional basis 
                if DIMVV > 1 is used pre-compilation.
     ctrl 1 : Sets up an experimental treatment of an uncoupled double well, without exact quadrupole 
                treatment, which is currently still being tested. Analytical gradients not implemented.          
     ctrl 2 : not used                      
     ctrl 3 : Exact quadrupole treatment, analytical gradients not implemented, increase in torsional 
                basis (e.g. "V 0 1  V 1 0") not implemented.
     
     qsum    (default 1000) partition function for SPCAT-type intensities.

     fsort   (default 3) This controls at which stage the F1 quantum number is assigned, relevant only
             for the two nuclei case. Case I: Separate by blocks of even and odd K as well as Wang signs
             first. Case II: use only separte blocks of even and odd K.
     fsort 1: Case I for A and E species
     fsort 2: Case II for A and E species
     fsort 3: Case I for A species and Case II for E species

     altering fsort might help if quantum number confusions are encounter (not uncommon in cases where 
     F1 is far from being a good quantum number)

New fit parameters:
     Several new parameters, unrelated to the quadrupole treatment, have been implemented into the code. 
     These parameters are still being tested and will be described in a later version.
     
Intensity calculations
     Previous XIAM versions did not implement intensity calculations for hyperfine components. An 
     approximation based on equation (15.142) from W. Gordy and R. L. Cook, Microwave Molecular Spectra, 
     3rd ed. (Wiley, New York, 1984), Vol. 18. has been implemented in XIAM-2NQ. 
     In this approximation, XIAM’s calculated non-hyperfine intensities are multiplied by 
     (2F1+1)x(2F1'+1)xsixj(J',F1',I1,F1,J,1)**2 x (2F+1)x(2F'+1)x sixj(F1',F',I2,F,F1,1)**2
     This approximations assumes that F1 and F are good quantum numbers. To loosen the restrictions
     on F1 a little, the F1 eigenvector components are used instead of the assigned F1 quantum number
     on ground and excited state. For each possible combination of F1 and F1' the expression is then  
     calculated and multiplied with the probability of the combination.
     
     To evaluate the 6j symbols, a function from the wigner.f90 module, written by O. C. Gorton 
     (https://github.com/ogorton/, ogorton@sdsu.edu), was rewritten into subroutines and integrated 
     into XIAM's source code.
     This approximate treatment is expected to be accurate for single nucleus cases of 
     D, N, and Cl nuclei. For Br and I nuclei, it should still provide reliable results 
     for most transitions; however, transitions with delta J > 1 can not be predicted this way. 
     For two nuclei cases the predicted intensities will become worse if the quadrupole coupling
     of the first nucleus 1 is not about 10 times larger than the quadrupole coupling of nucleus 2
     chi_1 > 10* chi_2. In the equivalent case chi_1 = chi_2, the intensities are little reliable 
     and tend to predict more components than are present in the experimental spectrum.
     

     Some changes have been made to the intensity predictions, and new output columns have been added:
        log10_str**2: Base-10 logarithm of the reduced transition dipole moment squared.
        log10_total : Used for control parameter 'limit', this is the log10(str**2 *d_pop) with d_pop as 
                      population difference. 
        stat.w.     : M Degeneracy of lower state (2*J+1) or (2*F+1) in case of hyperfine components.
        d_pop.      : Population difference between the two involved states. Assumed are delta_M = 0 
                      transition rules, which means in the calculation of the population 
                      difference only the lower value of J or F is used to calculate the 'degeneracy'
                      of upper and lower involved levels.
        spcat       : Intensities as in Pickett’s SPCAT.

XIAM-2NQ uses 2I as input for control parameter 'spin', it also uses 2F as input for the quantum number 'F'.

                     XIAM_mod are also available in XIAM-NQ.

  General Description
 
  XIAM can predict and fit the rotational spectrum of an asymmetric molecule
with maximal 3 symmetric internal rotors and one nucleus leading to a weak 
nuclear quadrupole coupling in the spectrum. Centrifugal distortion constants
of the overall rotation up to the 6th order and some 4th order distortion 
constants between the internal and overall rotation are included. To analyze
spectra of excited states of the internal rotation motion, some top-top 
coupling terms are used.

 Method 
 
  XIAM uses the internal axes method given by Woods [1,2] and modified by 
Vacherand et. al. [3]. The centrifugal distortion constants of the 
Watson' A and S reduction [4] and the van Eijck-Typke reduction  are used. 
The nuclear quadrupole coupling is implemented with the matrix elements 
given in [5] but neglects the J off-diagonal elements. 
This leads to a similar restriction as the normal perturbation treatment 
concerning the magnitude of the nuclear quadrupole coupling. 
To analyze excited states different sets of rotational  
and kinetic internal rotation constants can be fitted simultaneously.
This program is described and used in [6] as well. Please cite [6]! 

  Hamiltonian

The hamiltonian matrix is set up in the principal axes system PAS of the whole
molecule. Therefore the centrifugal distortion constants are comparable
with rigid rotor calculations. The internal rotation operator Hi of each top
is set up in his own internal axes system (rho-system: RAS) and the resulting
eigenvalues of the diagonalisation of Hi are transformed (rotated) into
the principal axes system. This transformation is done via a rotation about 
two Euler angles beta and gamma, were beta and gamma are the angles between 
the rho system and the principal axes system. P_r is the angular momentum 
vector along the rho axis.

                        rho_x 
 gamma = arccos ---------------------------- rotation about x axis
                (rho_x**2 + rho_y**2)**0.5

                        rho_z 
 beta  = arccos ------------------------------------- rotation about y axis
                (rho_x**2 + rho_y**2 + rho_z**2)**0.5

  The top-top coupling matrix elements Hii are calculated by transforming the
operator (p_alpha - rho P_r) into the principal axes system and multiplying
the matrices then.

       + Vss sin(n alpha_1) sin(n alpha_2)

  Spin Rotation parameters are
  C+  : C_x + C_y  
  C_z 
  C-  : C_x - C_y
 
 To fit different torsional states with different rotational constants,
 several indepentent sets of parameters can be used (maximum: DIMVB). 


  Input and Output

The input of XIAM is read from the standard input stream of the operating
system (UNIT=5), the output is written to the standard output stream (UNIT 6).
To use an input file on DOS, Unix, and OS/2 type

              xiam < inputfilename > outputfilename.

The input in a free format, it is analysed by the subroutine getx, which 
enables the user to write comments into the inputfile. They will be ignored
by XIAM. There are three types of comments:

 1) Pascal syntax:
           input_a {comment .. } input_b  
    is read  input_a input_b 

 2) Fortran 90 syntax:      
           input_a ! comment until end of line      
    is read  input_a
 
 3) Continuation character syntax:
           input_a \ comment until end of line
           input_b      
    is read  input_a input_b 

Comment 3) can be used to split one line over several lines in the 
input file. 
To get the '!', '{' or '\' characters without special meaning use 
'\!',  '\{' or '\\' instead. 

  The input of XIAM is divided into 7 blocks. Each block is separated 
from the other by an empty line. One block can not contain an empty line.
Each block has a special meaning:

1. Block: Title and Comments. 
   This block will be written into the output file without any changes.

2. Block: Control parameters.
   In this block basic numbers are given, e.g. the number of internal rotors,
   the nuclear spin I ...

3. Block: Molecular parameters.
   Here the initial values of the parameters of the Hamiltonian are given.

4. Block: Parameters to fit.
   The parameters (or linear combination of parameters) which are to be
   fitted are declared here.

5. Block: Symmetry labeling.
   The symmetry species of the internal rotation (A, E) are defined here.

6. Block: Torsional states.
   The torsional basis functions for the matrix are defined.

7. Block: Transitions
   The quantum numbers and frequencies (if already known) are typed here.

Block 5 and 6 can be omitted if only a rigid rotor is calculated.

The input of each block has always the form keyword value [value [value..]] 

Some control parameters are sums of binary numbers, were each binary number
has a special meaning (e.g. woods and adj).

Note: often the value of I_alpha is predicted by the geometry (methyl top
      I_alpha = 3.18 - 3.2 uAA). To fix this value in the fit one must  
      set F0 to the appropriate value (about 159 - 157 GHz) and set 
      the 4th bit of the control parameter 'adjf' (decimal 8).
      The parameter rho can not be fitted in this case.

      To fit the angles between of internal rotation axis directly 
      (instead of indirectly with gamma and beta) the 5th bit of the 
      'adjf' parameter must be set (decimal 16). Gamma and beta can 
      not be fitted then. 
      

4. Block (fitting of parameters)

 In this block each line must begin with 'fit', 'dqu', dqx followed by the name
of the parameter to be fitted. If linear combinations of parameters are fitted,
the syntax is:
fit/dqu/dqx  parameter 1   coefficient 1   parameter 2   coefficient 2 ...
The number of lines in this block is the number of independent parameters
in the fit. 

fit   fit parameters using analytic derivatives
dqu   fit parameters using difference quotients to calculate the derivatives
dqx   fit parameters using two difference quotients to calculate the 
      derivatives 
parameter   is the keyword of the parameter (see 3th block)
coefficient is a number giving the coefficient for the linear combination.  

 The dqu/x keyword allows two optional numbers to occur before the first 
parameter. The first number gives the step width in percent for the 
differential quotient (default 0.1%), the second number is multiplied with
the variated parameter after the fit (Hartley convergence parameter).

 Not all parameters can be fitted with analytic derivatives, 
in the moment only the rigid rotor parameters have this feature.
They are denoted with a '*' in the table above. 
Maybe analytic derivatives of some other parameters will be available in 
the future, but the differential quotient method will always be necessary 
if (a) the parameters are affected by the 'adjf' control keyword and 
(b) woods 64 is used (Vacherand Method).

If only a prediction is wanted the 4 block can be replaced by an empty line.

Examples for fitting of linear combinations:
 
 dqu  V1n_1 1.0  V1n_2 1.0 
    The potential parameter V3 for two equivalent tops is fitted. 

 dqu  delta_1 1.0  delta_2  -1.0 
    Here the sum of the angles delta_1 and delta_2 is kept constant.
    This may be necessary if the molecule possesses a symmetry plane. 

5. Block (torsional symmetry)

S (or G for compatibility with old versions) followed by the sigma
  for each top.
Each line in this block defines the symmetry species of the torsional part.
Example for one three fold top 

   S  0        ! this is the A Species  (0 : sigma =0)
   S  1        ! this is the E Species  (1 : sigma =1)

Example for two different tops

  S  0 0  ! Top 1: sigma=0   Top 2: sigma=0  total symmetry AA
  S  0 1  ! Top 1: sigma=0   Top 2: sigma=1  total symmetry EiE
  S  1 0  ! Top 0: sigma=1   Top 2: sigma=1  total symmetry EEj
  S  1 1  ! Top 1: sigma=1   Top 2: sigma=1  total symmetry AE
  S -1 1  ! Top 1: sigma=-1  Top 2: sigma=1  total symmetry EA

A name of the symmetry species can be added at the beginning of a line,
the name must start with a slash:
 /A  S 0
 /E  S 1
The name is used in the output of the transitions.

6. Block 

V (only one keyword) followed by torsional state of each top.

 Each line in this block gives one set of rotational constants.
Example for one top in the ground state:

  V 0  ! matrix size is (2J+1) * (2J+1) 
 
 Example for two tops in the ground state:

  V 0 0 ! matrix size is (2J+1) * (2J+1) 
 
 Example for one top in the ground and first excited state with different 
sets of rotational constants for the states: 

  V 0   ! matrix size of ground state is (2J+1) * (2J+1) 
  V 1   ! matrix size of first excited state is (2J+1) * (2J+1) 
The constants of the second line are calculated from the constants of the
first line plus additional terms +BJ_2, +BK_2,  .., +gam_2.
In the transition list (block 7) B 1 refers to the ground state, B 2 to the 
excited state.

One line can include several V's. This will increase the size of the matrix
to include off diagonal matrix elements <v| H |v'>.
Example for one top in the ground and first excited state with the same
set of constants:  

  V 0  V 1  ! matrix size is [(2J+1)+(2J+1)] * [(2J+1)+(2J+1)]
            ! which includes ground and first excited state in one matrix 
In the transition list (block 7) V 1 refers to the ground state, V 2 to the 
excited state.

 Example for two tops in the first and second excited state, the
off diagonal elements are necessary for the top top interaction operators:

  V 0 1  V 1 0  ! matrix size is [(2J+1)+(2J+1)] * [(2J+1)+(2J+1)]


7. Block

Each line is one transition, the sequence of the keywords is arbitrary.
                   
Jup   Jlo     or  J    J quantum number

K-up  K-lo    or  K-   K minus and K plus (pseudo) quantum numbers
K+up  K+lo    or  K+   K- and K+ are only used to calculate t

=                      Frequency, if '=' not given, the predicted frequency 
                                  will be written, default GHz 

Err                    Frequency error

Sup   Slo     or  S    Torsional symmetry. the number refers to the n-th line
                       in block 5. a symmetry number of -1 indicates a rigid 
                       rotor transition

V1up  V1lo    or  V1   If more than one V keywords are given in one line of the
                       6th block, V 1 refers to the lowest, V 2 to the next
                       higher torsional level in the matrix, ....

V2up  V2lo             (not used)

Bup   Blo     or  B    the n-th set of rotational constants are used 
                       (refers to the n-th line in the 6th block). 

Fup   Flo     or  F    twice F, a F value of -1 indicates a transition without
                       nq-hfs

Tup   Tlo     or  T    tau number of the whole matrix ranging over all 
                       torsional states. tau numbers the eigenvalues in 
                       ascending order, starting with t 1
 
tup   tlo     or  t    tau number (range 1 - 2J+1) for one torsional state 

#                      splitting fit: the number (counted relatively from this 
                       transition) refers to the reference transition.
                       Example: # -1: the difference between this frequency
                                     and the previous frequency will be fitted 
                       If this transition is a prediction, the calc. splitting
                       is printed in the obs-calc output field. Furthermore,
                       if the reference transition was given, this frequency
                       is used as an offset to calculate the new frequency.
  
&                      average fit see '#'

Kup   Klo     or  K    K quantum number. This is a good quantum number for 
                       the E-states, especially at low barriers. 
                       For A-states the sign of K indicates the symmetry of
                       the eigenvector.

diff                   splitting input: the number refers to the reference
                       transition. The frequency following '= ' is the 
                       difference between the absolute frequency and the 
                       absolute frequency of the reference transition. 
                       if diff 0 is given and ref '#' has a value the 
                       '#' value will also be taken as the diff value.

GHz   MHz  cm-1        Units for the Frequency

Without Keywords the input is straightforward:

                                    keywords
